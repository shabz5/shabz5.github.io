<ul type="circle">
  <li> <b>Check</b>-If you decide to check is means that you pass on your turn while keeping hold of your cards. The next player can now take their move.
    You don’t have to add anything to the pot when you check. This is a safe move</li>
  <li> <b>Bet </b> -You may bet if no other players have bet during the current round.
    Once a bet has been made, other players must ‘call’ by matching the amount bet, in order to remain in the hand.</li>
  <li> <b>Call</b>- You can call if other players have bet during the current round; this requires the calling player to match the highest bet made. </li>
  <li> <b>Fold</b>- This is basically quitting the game. You cant make any more actions during this round if oce you have folded. </li>
  <li> <b>Raise</b> You may raise if other players have bet during the current round; you must match and exceed the current bet.
